# NetVision AI

## AI‑Powered Network Traffic Visualizer & Packet Intelligence Platform

---

## 1. Project Overview

**NetVision AI** is a desktop-based network traffic visualizer and packet analysis platform inspired by Wireshark and enhanced with Artificial Intelligence. The application enables users to load and analyze PCAP/PCAPNG files, visualize raw and decoded packet data, perform traffic analysis, and interact with an AI assistant for explanations, learning, and threat detection.

This project is designed for:

* Networking & Cybersecurity learning
* Interview preparation
* Traffic troubleshooting
* Security analysis demonstrations

---

## 2. Objectives

* Build a Wireshark-like desktop application using Python
* Provide deep packet inspection (DPI)
* Visualize raw packet bytes and decoded protocol layers
* Implement Wireshark-style display filters
* Integrate AI for packet explanation, traffic summaries, and anomaly detection
* Maintain security by avoiding raw packet uploads to cloud AI

---

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Packet Visualization

* Open and parse PCAP / PCAPNG files
* Packet list with time, source, destination, protocol, length
* Raw packet data in hexadecimal format
* Layer-by-layer decoded packet structure

### 3.2 Packet Analysis

* Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP support
* TCP flags, sequence and acknowledgment numbers
* TCP stream reconstruction (Follow TCP Stream)
* Flow-based conversation tracking

### 3.3 Filters (Wireshark-Style)

* Protocol filters: tcp, udp, icmp
* Address filters: ip.addr == X.X.X.X
* Port filters: tcp.port == 80

### 3.4 Traffic Statistics

* Protocol distribution
* Top talkers (most active IPs)
* Packet and bandwidth usage statistics
* Error and retransmission counters

---

## 4. AI Integration

### 4.1 AI Capabilities

The integrated AI assistant provides:

* Plain-English explanation of selected packets
* Capture-level traffic summaries
* Detection of suspicious patterns (e.g., SYN floods, port scans)
* Learning mode for beginners
* Interview-oriented Q&A generation
* Suggested filters based on traffic patterns

### 4.2 AI Safety Strategy

* Raw PCAP files are never sent to AI services
* Only structured summaries and metadata are shared
* Offline local LLM support (optional)

Example AI input structure:

```
{
  "protocols": {"TCP": 120, "UDP": 30},
  "top_ports": [80, 443],
  "anomalies": ["High SYN rate from 10.0.0.5"]
}
```
